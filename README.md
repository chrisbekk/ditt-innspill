# DittInnspill

This is a developer case based on the website mittinnspill.no by Norkart. The aim was to recreate the design and functionality of the website as closely as possible.

The process entailed analyzing the functionality of the page, make a mock-up design prototype and decide on relevant technologies to use. I started by walking through the website and recognize each technology used and how it was implemented. I used developer tools to gain an understanding on how data was fetched, and how components were built. I also took notice of how components interacted with user inputs, and made notes on how I could implement similiar functionality. Secondly, I started working on a prototype design in Figma. This allowed me to gain additional understanding about the design and layout of the website, and meant I could start planning how I should design individual components in the developmental stage. 

Working on this project meant I had to get familiar with Mapbox as well. I had some experience with Google Maps, but wanted to use the same technology as the original.
